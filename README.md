# What is it?
This is my custom and naive reimplementation of C++ std::vector with some specific features

## How to add into proj
just include header cvector.h into your code and enjoy

## How to use
examples of using you can find in the VectorTests.cpp file

## How stable?
Well... it is covered with tests only for int and std::string types
